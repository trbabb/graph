# trbabb/graph

A simple, header-only, templated C++ directed graph implementation.

Graphs may optionally associate values with vertices and edges. Additionally, it
is possible to index vertices and edges with custom types using the provided `DigraphMap`
class.

Graphs are implemented using underlying hash maps that associate unique identifiers with
vertex and edge data. The hash map implementation may be provided as a template parameter,
so that the graph structure may take advantage of modern, performant hash map implementations.
Iterator invalidation rules are inherited from the underlying hash map implementation.

The interface is designed to be simple, intuitive, and flexible, with attention to performance.

The implementation is written in C++20.

## Building

The library is header-only; it isn't necessary to build it. Simply copy the `graph` directory
to the system header include directory. This can also be done with `make install`.

Documentation may be regenerated by running `make docs`.

## Testing

Testing requires [SCons](https://scons.org/). To run tests, run
    
    scons test
    
in the root project directory.

To enable a debug build for testing:

    scons test debug=1

To disable optimization:

    scons test noopt=1

To turn on address sanitization:

    scons test --sanitize
