# trbabb/graph

A simple, header-only, templated C++ directed graph implementation.

Graphs may optionally associate values with vertices and edges. Additionally, it
is possible to index vertices and edges with custom types using the provided `DigraphMap`
class.

Graphs are implemented using hash maps that associate unique identifiers with
vertex and edge data. The hash map implementation may be provided as a template parameter,
so that the graph structure may take advantage of modern, performant hash map implementations.
Iterator invalidation rules are inherited from the underlying hash map implementation.

`graph` is written in C++20.

## Documentation

[API Documentation](http://trbabb.github.io/graph/html/annotated.html)

## Building

The library is header-only; it isn't necessary to build it. Simply copy the `graph` directory
to the system header include directory. This can also be done with `make install`.

Documentation may be regenerated by running `make docs`. This requires
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

## Testing

Testing-only dependencies (these are **NOT** required to include the library!):
    - [SCons](https://scons.org/)
    - [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
    - [PCG Random](https://www.pcg-random.org/index.html)
    - [ankerl/unordered_dense](https://github.com/martinus/unordered_dense)

To run tests:
    
    scons test
    
in the root project directory.

To enable a debug build for testing:

    scons test debug=1

To disable optimization:

    scons test noopt=1

To turn on address sanitization:

    scons test --sanitize


# Todo

- It is currently possible to slice a `DiagraphMap` into a `Digraph`, and mutations to the
latter will invalidate the key-mapping in the former by failing to maintain it. This needs to
be remedied by making a hidden base class which both classes derive from, instead of directly
deriving one from the other.

- The build system is rudimentary; it would be better to provide a `.configure` script. I don't
know `autoconf` but would accept PRs that accomplish this!

- Performance comparisons with other libraries

- More tests
