# trbabb/graph

A simple, header-only, templated C++ directed graph implementation.

Graphs may optionally associate values with vertices and edges. Additionally, it
is possible to index vertices and edges with custom types using the provided `DigraphMap`
class.

Graphs are implemented using hash maps that associate unique identifiers with
vertex and edge data. The hash map implementation may be provided as a template parameter,
so that the graph structure may take advantage of modern, performant hash map implementations.
Iterator invalidation rules are inherited from the underlying hash map implementation.

`graph` is written in C++20.

## Documentation

[API Documentation](http://trbabb.github.io/graph/html/annotated.html)

## Building

The library is header-only; it isn't necessary to build it. Simply copy the `graph` directory
to the system header include directory. This can also be done with `make install`.

Documentation may be regenerated by running `make docs`. This requires
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

## Testing

Testing requires [SCons](https://scons.org/). To run tests, run
    
    scons test
    
in the root project directory.

To enable a debug build for testing:

    scons test debug=1

To disable optimization:

    scons test noopt=1

To turn on address sanitization:

    scons test --sanitize
